# Python-mini-games
A Jupyter Notebook featuring three beginner-friendly Python games: Number Guessing, Rock Paper Scissors, and a Math Quiz game.
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with 3 interactive, beginner-friendly Python games. These games are text-based and designed to help new programmers learn basic logic, control flow, and user input handling in Python.

## Games Included

1. **Number Guessing Game**
   - The computer randomly selects a number between 1-50.
   - The player guesses for max 5 attempts.
   - Feedback is given after each guess (too high/too low).

2. **Rock Paper Scissors**
   - A player vs computer game.
   - Player can enter number of rounds they want to play.
   - The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.

   - The winner is determined using classic game rules.

3. **Math Quiz**
   - Random math questions (addition, subtraction, etc.).
   - User inputs answers, and score is tracked.
   - Great for practicing math and logic.
